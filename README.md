# Sakura Bloom Prediction 2025 ðŸŒ¸

This project aims to predict the first and full bloom dates of cherry blossoms in 2025 using historical bloom data. The dataset includes records from 1953 to 2024 across multiple observation sites in Japan.

## Current Status
- **Data Cleaning Completed**: The historical bloom data has been cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy.

## Next Steps
- **Modeling**: I will now focus on developing a predictive model using time series forecasting techniques to estimate the bloom dates for 2025.
- **Trend Analysis & Visualization**: Analyze seasonal patterns and trends, followed by visualizing the forecasted bloom dates.

## Goals
- Clean and preprocess historical bloom data
- Analyze trends and seasonal patterns
- Build a predictive model using time series forecasting
- Visualize and interpret bloom predictions for 2025

Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€
